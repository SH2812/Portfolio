<div class="welcome">
  <p style="text-indent: 50px"><font size ="4">As you can probably guss, my name is Sophia Huynh.
    I am from Atlanta, Georgia as a current rising Junior at the Paideia School.
    I can be pretty identifiable: to my friends, I am the one who always has music playing in the
    background and something new to share everyday.  To others, I might be the random girl bursting into
    song, dancing freely around the lot.  I will admit, I can be a bit spontaneous, but rest assured,
    I'm not <em>that</em> crazy.</font></p>


<p style="text-indent: 50px"><font facefont size ="4">
    As for my hobbies, I love to write poetry(specifically slam poetry), listen and play music with <em>everthing</em>, eat new foods,
    travel, have new experiences, meet new people, and advocate for human rights and diversity.
     My dream is to travel the world, learn and be immersed
      in different cultures, and try to help in anything that I can.</font></p>

      <p style="text-indent: 50px"><font facefont size ="4">
        I really believe technology is
       extremely veritile and has billions of possibilities.
      Through the Girls Who Code Program, I have also become very
      interested in how technology interacts with our daily lives,
      and how we can use it to solve world problems.
