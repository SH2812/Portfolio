  <h4>Human Rights guarantee the equality of all people, integrity of the person, privacy, personal freedoms and fulfillment of basic existential and social needs.
	As said before, Human Rights are the rights and freedoms that belong to each and every person because we are ALL human beings.</h4>

        <h2>The UDHR</h2>
        <img src="https://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Passport_UDHRs.jpg">

      <h4>  The UDHR is otherwise known as The Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  This legal document has been signed by many countries worldwide.   However, oftentimes, these rights are being violated.  That is why organizations such as Unicef, Amnesty, and the Human Rights Organizations call out countries who violate them.
<p>
	The UDHR was originally created by Elenor Rossevelt.  She campaigned vigorously for other countries to sign it around the world, and after WWII, in 1948, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) was adopted.  This document was the first steps in giving individuals tool in the fight against oppression.  It includes: the right to life, education, expression, standard of living(housing, food, clothing, and water), social security,prohibition of tourture, and the right to work and liberty.  States have adopted additional international treaties and agreements such as:
<p>
	1)Rights on civil and political issues
  <p>
	2)Rights on economic, social and cultural issues
<p>
  3)Rights against racial discrimination
<p>
  4)Rights of migrant workers
<p>
  5)Rights of people with disabilities
<p>
  6)Rights of children
<p>
  7)Rights of women
  <p>
	Under the UDHR, the government is supposed to:
Respect our rights: to refrain from undue interference(police violence, torture, arbitrary executions or arrest)
Protect our rights: take measures to prevent abuse of our rights  by others(against domestic violence and environmental pollution by big companies)
Fulfill our rights: to create the legal and institutional framework so our rights can be guaranteed(build schools and hospitals and adopt laws prohibiting crimes against life and property)
